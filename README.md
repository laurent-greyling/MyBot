# MyBot

Bots are not a new thing in the world, but lately it has become the best new thing since toast. To create a new bot is fairly simple with [Microsoft's Bot Framework](https://dev.botframework.com/). Here you can find all documentation to start.

For my first bot, and to keep track of the process I will follow and use documents available in the documentation section of [Microsoft's Bot Framework](https://dev.botframework.com/).

To make it easier I will setout step by step how I followed and build this bot.

##Getting Started

To get started with the bot framework download and install the [Bot Application template](http://aka.ms/bf-bc-vstemplate)

[Getting started](https://docs.botframework.com/en-us/csharp/builder/sdkreference/)

It is always nice to look at some code samples when starting a new project. For those moments you get stuck you can review the samples [here](https://github.com/Microsoft/BotBuilder/tree/master/CSharp)


Revisit [this](https://docs.botframework.com/en-us/csharp/builder/sdkreference/dialogs.html) later, this is for dialog and not the frame...
